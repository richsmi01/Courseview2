Bug!!!  Some professor content not showing up when logged in as student
Can we build a view to output every bit of data about an object? including acls
Adding friends/groups etc...can I automatically add new users to be my friend or be in my group?
Can we set up a media type that defaults to group mode?  So we set up a section in settings that allows us to pass the group id instead of the user id
video plugin?

Jan 16

    discuss breadcrumbs
    when deleting a blog post, how can I make it go back to courseview content page
    discuss cvforwardintercept and why
    When logged out, how can I change the splash screen to my own instead of activity list
ajax with elgg

Next discussion - Jan 9

--- Discussion of acl interception
---- walk through cv_professor_contentview with Matt and move relevant stuff to actions
- discuss cvforwardintercept and why: 
- discuss stories  object view how to detect full or not full view

- How do I create a page that spans the entire width and doesn't have a sidebar.
- How can I change the header section completely
- When logged out, how can I change the splash screen to my own instead of activity list

Note to Rich - Probably need to add a metatag to cohorts called active and then add a form to allow the
professor to choose which cohorts to make active for his/her view.  Then, when building the treeview of the
menu, only cohorts whose active tag is set to true will be listed.  Could just add this to the manage courseview div



December 19 -

- walk through cvaddtocohorttreeview.  Get Matt to give his opinion as to cleaning the code

- Understand how the public, private etc works in plain, vanilla elgg

Discussion about:
How can I create a custom access-level that will let all students of any cohort in a particular course be able to see and professor content
while not allowing that content to be seen by outsiders.


is there a google adsense plugin?  How would I do this?
is there a streaming video plugin?
ist there a quiz or flashcard plugin?
Is there any way for me to manually go in and delete entities using admin tools?

Note to Rich - Need to add a way for professors (and students maybe) to mark a cohort as archived or not active etc...

Dec 5

- A couple things about my code on linux -- crash when creating new content

- my sidebar css isn't working on the linux -- but my other css is working?

-  How can I create my own log messages?

- wiki discussion

-  How can I change the css for the sidebar width? --Think I got it...one quick question.

Nov 21 agenda

Rough week...didn't get much done...

--can we build a form with checkboxes and input box and then the action that can process it?

--is there a way that we can tap into a page that has just edited and saved an element?

--walk through my idea about adding the tree to the bottom of each page

Nov 14 agenda

How can we hack the edit and create views of plugins to allow us to add relationships to our menu items?

x  problem with adding polls - creates extra objects for choices

problem when adding content, loses the current menu item when complete

x Can we add more plugins that athabasca uses ...like wikis

Nov 7 agenda

Request for less polite critique of code

Actions and tokens one last time...turning courseview on and off

passing stuff to views... the $vars array?

Discuss new requirement to add content to courseview from outside of courseview...during creation and editing

Discuss my idea to do away with cohort selection and just build all cohorts into the treeview

Discuss problems with persisting treeview

need to be able to ascertain whether or not a user belongs to any CV groups

need to fetch all cohorts that a user is a member of

Can I figure out what submit button was hit on a form?  edit menu item example

How can I connect the cveditcourse action to the checkbox that shows the course editing stuff

Where should I use extend view vs require?

Setting up a quasi-production courseview site in the next couple weeks



Oct 24 Agenda -

How do I get the checkboxes working in settings page?

How do I control the dropdown selection in the contentpane ?

In Start.php, how do I redirect back to the coursview page after going to the content creation page?

How can I get the contentpane form to call the action?

How can I get the Courseview menu item to call the action?




Oct 17 Agenda -

Once again, I had a rough week and didn't get much done on this...However, I think I've got enough done for us
to move forward on a couple important points.

-  When viewing a module of type student, I'd like to be able to filter by the various plugin types.
        - For instance, filter by blog, bookmark, file etc.
-  As I filter by a particular plugin, I'd like a button to appear that will allow me to add content of that type.
        -  For instance, if I'm filtering by "blog", there should be a "add blog entry" button
-  I need to intercept the creation of this content and add the appropriate relationships.

If we can cover some of this, I have a reading week next week so I should have time to completely clean up all my 
code so we can move forward in a more organized, less frenetic prototyping fashion!




Oct 10 Agenda -

-  Walk through my updated design

-  If I pull out a bunch of objects by relationship, how can I efficiently sort them by an attribute like sortorder=1, 2 etc?

- So, If I'm making all these decisions based on passing values through the url, then how do we stop users from spoofing the url?

- I'm not really understanding how to retrieve information back out of the url...

-  Can we walk through a form and action type scenario?

- A couple git questions.

Oct 2 Agenda - Hey Matt...sorry but I'm not as prepared as I should be...caught a touch of the flu over the 
weekend and I'm just starting to feel better...

Anyway, I thought we could discuss the following:

- Is there any way that you are comfortable with that would let you view my screen remotely?  I know that Chrome has a couple plugins but 
I want to be sure that you're ok with the security aspects of doing this.  If you are, it would make things much easier as I could show you the code 
that I'm having trouble with, I could run it, you could see the results and make suggestions.

-  I've been sketching out what I think the app should look like since I was too sick to make it over to the computer...I just transferred
my thoughts to a ppt which I'll send you and walk you through to see if you have any comments or suggestions.

-  I have a little chunk of code in testinginit (under pages) that I would like to discuss with you...I have a lot of quesions.
    --what is the best way to add metadata?  is it set? set_meta_data, or simply adding a field?

- I'd like to know how I could add a link to the group edit page after intercepting that page with my elgg_register_event_handler('pagesetup', 'system','interceptpagesetup'); in 
the start.php file.

Thanks eh!
Rich.

Sept 26 Agenda:

-  Walk through start and content pane and get feedback about how I'm doing things
-  Talk about how I should use views more advantageously and don't just use elgg_echo everywhere
-  Have him walk me through how he would find out more about this group add function stuff
-  Have him walk me through how he would find out more about elgg_get_entity_by...
-  Discuss hosting a test elgg site for reporting to athabasca profs

Stuff for Rich to do next week

-  work through Matt's css tutorial plugin and fix up the course menu
- figure out the whole building the course tree into a group object thing
- fix up how I'm using views so I use less ad-hoq elgg_echo's through the code.
